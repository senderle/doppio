          "It is respectfully announced to the Ladies and Gentlemen of Bristol and its Vicinity, that with every wish to bring before them the first species of Novelty exhibited and approved at the London Theatres, the Manager has engaged the celebrated and unrivalled Madame Saqui whose wonderful feats on the tight rope, at Paris and most of the European Capitals have acquired her universally the character of The First Perfomer in the World! Her present engagement is unavoidably limited to three Nights only, during which she will exhibit all her various surprising efforts as repeated upwards of Ferry Nights at the Theatre-Royal, Covent-Garden, to overflowing Houses, and since for three successive Seasons, with unprecedented Nightly attraction at the Vauxhall-Gardens. She will be supported through part of her Ertainments by the admired Mademoiselle Saqui, who is also engaged for three Nights previous to their appearance in the Edinburgh and Glasgow Theatres-Royal."
