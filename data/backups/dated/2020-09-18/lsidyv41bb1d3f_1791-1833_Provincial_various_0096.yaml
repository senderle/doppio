        - '[Description of Benighted Travellers:] Raymond
        having completed his studies, is entreated by his Father to enter on
        his Travels. He sets out, accompanied by Theodore, his faithful
        Domestic. On entering the Confines of the Forest of Rosenwald, Night
        drawing on, he loses his Way, and, by the Treachery of his Guide
        (Claude), he is led to the Cottage of a Woodman (Baptista,) the
        Captain of a Banditti, who assumes that Disguise more securely to
        commit his Depredations on the unwary Traveller. Robert and Jacques
        (Sons to Baptista) return from their Plunder in the Forest, and enter
        armed. Raymond is conducted to repose in a Chamber. Baptista and Sons
        lay a Plot to murder him. Marguerette, in Order to put Raymond on his
        Guard, contrives to place a Pillow stained with Blood on his Bed,
        Robert enters the Chamber, and attempts the Murder, but is prevented
        by Marguerette's Caution; Agnes and her Governante now enter the
        Cottage, being benighted in their Journey to the Castle of Lindenberg.
        Raymond, enamoured of Agnes, resolves on saving her: and Marguerette,
        giving him to understand the Wine which is offered is an Opiate, he
        pretends to drink, and affects to sleep.-- The Murderers, thinking
        their Victims secure, leave them to Baptista, who is preparing to
        assassinate Agnes, when he meets his Death by the very Dagger he had
        raised against the Bosom of sleeping Innocence. Agnes relates the Story
        of the BLEEDING NUN!!! And tells him that it is reported that the
        Spectre haunts the Castle every fifth years. "When the Castle Bell
        tolls One, Expect me as the Bleeding Nun," The Castle Gates open and the
        Apparition of the Bleeding Nun appears.
