          [Description of Forest Bondy]: This piece is founded on the following fact, as related by the celebrated French Author, St. FOIX. "Aubri de Mondidier, travelling alone through the Forest Bondy, was murdered, and buryed under a tree. His dog would not quit his master's grave for several days, till at length, compelled by hunger, he went to the house of an intimate Friend of the unfortunate AUBRI, at Paris, and by his melancholy howling, seemed desirious of expressing the loss they had both sustained. He repeated his cries, ran to the door, then looked back to see whether any body followed him, returned ot his master's friend, pulled him by the sleve, and with dumb eloquence intreated him to go with him. The singularity of all the actions of the faithful animal, his coming there without his mater, whose constant companion he had always had been; the sudden disappearance of AUBRI, and perhaps that divine dispensation of events, which will not permit the guilty to remain long undetected,- all (and several) these circumstances induced the company to follow the dog, who conducted them to the fatal tree, where he renewed his howl, scrathcing the earth with his feet, to signify that this was the spot where they ought to search. Accordingly on digging, the body of the unfortunate AUBRI was discovered." The following New Scenery painted for the occasion by Messrs. Cowell and Brown. INSIDE OF A GOTHIC HALL. Open Court of the Inn, with a View of Distant Country. Gallery of the Inn, Terrace, and DISTANT MOUNTAINS. [Description of Travellers Benighted]: Travellers Benighted. New Scenery Painted by Messrs. Cowell and Brown. Kitchen of Baptista's Cottage. Bed Room in Cottage. Outside of Lindenberg Castle. Transparent Cloud, which rises as the Spectre Descends, Bearing the following inscription- "Protect the Child of the Murdered Anges." Cavern Scene, Which opens and discovers the Spectre Nun ascending amidst Clouds. Full length Portrait of the BLEEDING-NUN, and Bust of Raymond.
