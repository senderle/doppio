          [Description of Travellers Benighted]: This unrivalled, popular and
          most interesting Play, commences with Don Felix wishing his Son to
          Travil; fearing his health will be imparised by his too constant
          study. Raymond sets forth and sees Agnes, who his leaving the Convent,
          in which she has been educated, and instantly becomes enamoured with
          her, but is prevented from expressing his admiration by the vigilance
          of her Duenna.

          Claude, a Postillion, who is connected with a band of Robbers, that
          infest a Forest thro' which they pass, breaks the carriage in which 
          Raymond Travels, as if by accident, and betrays him to the Banditti
          under pretence of finding shelter for the night. Raymond encounters a
          variety of adventures, and finally escapes with Agnes and her Duenna,
          who have also been conducted by a treacherous guide to his ABODE OF
          HORROR, and reaches the Castle of Lindenberg unmolested; the Baron
          receives him with kindness as the protector of Agnes, but being
          informed that he is paying his addresses to her, he instantly
          dismisses him from the Castle, Agnes is determined to follow his
          fortunes, and inform him of her intention of personating a bleeding
          Nun, (which is reported nocturnally to preambulate the Castle Walls,
          exactly at one o'Clock,) by dropping from a window with this Scroll.
          "When the Castle Bell tolls one, Expect me like the Bleeding Nun."
          Delighted with this information, he punctually attends and as the
          Clock strikes one, the Spectre of a Nun with a Lamp in one hand and a
          Dagger in the other, it appears Raymond supposeing it to be Agnes,
          follows and attempts to embrace it on which it vanishes and in its
          room appears a transparency with this inscription. Protect the Child
          of the Murdered Agnes!Agnes not meeting with Raymond sets out in
          search of him and falls a second time into the hands of the Banditti,
          but is happily rescued by Raymond's timely interference, and this
          interesting Piece concludes with their offering of thankfulness and
          gratitude to that Providence who never fails.
