          [Description of Raymond and Agnes]: Principal Scenery and Incidents.
          The inside of the Hovel - Marguerite and her Child discovered - The
          Bed-room prepared for Raymond - Marguerite wishing to preserve the
          life of Raymond and the Assassins, conveys A PILLOW STAINED WITH BLOOD
          !! upon his Bed, thereby to inform him of his danger - She conceals
          herself. Raymond retires to rest, but is prevented by finding the
          BLOODY PILLOW! Robert enters; attempting to MURDER HIM, Is prevented
          by Marguerite, and Raymond, at her request retires. The lower part of
          the Hovel - Robert informs his Father and Brother of the ineffectual
          attempt on the life of Raymond, who is brought in by Marguerite - A
          knocking in heard without - Agnes is led in by Claude - supper is
          prepared, opiates are mixed with wines, Agnes drinks, and falls into a
          slumber - Baptista supposing Raymond at rest, prepares to murder him,
          Raymond seizes him and Baptista falls by the hands of Marguerite. The
          outside of the Castle - Raymond's departure - A Letter from Agnes
          informs him that "When the Castle Bell tolls One, he is to expect her
          like the Bleeding Nun." - Outside of the Castle as before - Raymond
          enters - THE CLOCK STRIKES ONE! - THE GATES FLY OPEN - the Apparition
          of THE NUN COMES FROM THE CASTLE. A dreary Wood - Raymond following
          the Spectre, still supposing it to be Agnes, attempts to embrace it,
          when suddenly vanishing, A CLOUD RISES FROM THE EARTH! bearing the
          following inscription: - "PROTECT THE CHILD OF THE MURDERED AGNES."
          Theodore and Marguerite meet Raymond - inform him of Agnes being
          seized by the Robbers, they hasten to her rescue. The three Robbers
          cast lots for the possession of Agnes - she becomes the prize of
          Robert; he attempts to seize her, she resisting, he aims a Dagger at
          her breast; at this instant, Raymond, Theodore, and Marguerite rush
          in, Robert falls by the Dagger of Raymond - Jaques by the sword of
          Theodore - Claude by a Pistol from the hands of Marguerite! - The
          piece concludes with the happy UNION OF RAYMOND AND AGNES !!
