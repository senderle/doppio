      notes:
        - '[On back of the playbill]: Among the many interesting incidents with which this Piece abounds, is The Arrival of the Travellers at the Cottage of Baptista, Who, in league with a desperate Band, headed by his Sons, make several attempts to accomplish the MURDER OF RAYMOND, Who is, however, informed of his danger by Margaretta, by means of a BLOOD-STAINED PILLOW, With which she furnishes his bed, and is by her, prevented from swallowing a sleeping potion, mixed in his drink by Baptista, whom he overcomes at the moment he is about to perpetrate the Murder of Agnes, and assisted by Margaretta, Accomplishes his Death. By means of of a concealed pannel, leading to a lone path through the Forest, they, accompanied by Margaretta, escape the Banditti, and arrive safe at the CASTLE OF LINDENBERG. At length Raymond, among a train of Adventures in his pursuit of Agnes, encounters the SPECTRE NUN, Whom he discovers to be the Mother of Agnes, and to whose spirit he swears, from that moment, to protect the offspring. He afterwards fulfills his Oath, by rescuing her from the Cave of Robbers. A COMBAT OF FOUR. The Shade of the Murdered Agnes Being appeased, blesses the union of the Child with her deliverer, which terminates the Drama, forming a striking and interesting conclusion.'

            For the Benefit of the Misses Leigh. The Misses Leigh beg most
            respectfully to announce the appointment of their Benefit for
            Tuesday, the 4th of February. As strangers they feel diffident in
            soliciting the public patronage, yet they trust the Dramatic
            arrangements of the evening will afford them a share of that favor
            which it will ever be their pleasing study to cherish and deserve.
