          [Description of the Nun]: Don Raymond having taken leave of his
          Father, sets out on his Travels, but stopping at Madrid, meets with
          the fair Agnes, who is placed in a Convent opposite his hotel. He
          quits Madrid to pursue his journey, but having taken as a guide a
          Bandit, HE IS DECOYED IN THE FOREST TO THE COTTAGE OF BAPTISTE. After
          escaping the treachery of the two sons of Baptiste, by the heroism of
          Marguerette who before he retires to bed, shews the pillow Which is
          covered with Blood. He preserves the life of Agnes, who is also
          decoyed to the Cottage, conveys her to the Castle of Lindenberg. He is
          refused the hand of Agnes by her Uncle, when he endeavours to procure
          and interview with her by a scroll, on which is written- "When the
          Castle Bell tolls one, Expect me as the Bleeding Nun!" He attends the
          appointed spot, when the real spectre appears to him with a lamp and a
          dagger, decoys him to an unfrequented part of the Wood, and vanishes
          in a FLAME OF FIRE!! When a scroll appears written in Letters of
          Blood! "Protect the Child of the Murdered Agnes." Agnes  also attends
          as the Ghost, who after disappointments, meets with Raymond, and their
          union is sanctioned by the presence of the BLEEDING NUN, And the
          Destruction of the Banditti.
