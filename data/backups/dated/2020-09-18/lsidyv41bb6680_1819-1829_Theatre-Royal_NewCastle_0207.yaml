          [Sketch of The Travellers Benighted]: Sketch of the Story:- Raymond
          having completed his studies, is entreated by his Father to enter on
          his Travels. He sets out, accompanied by Theodore, his faithful
          Domestic. On entering the Confines of the Forest of Rosenwald, Night
          drawing on, he loses his Way, and, by the Treachery of his Guide
          (Claude), he is led to the Cottage of a Woodman (Baptista,) the
          Captain of a Banditti, who assumes that Disguise more securely to
          commit his Depredations on the unwary Traveller. Robert and Jacques
          (Sons to Baptista) return from their Plunder in the Forest, and enter
          armed. Raymond is conducted to repose in a Chamber. Baptista and Sons
          lay a Plot to murder him. Marguerette, in Order to put Raymond on his
          Guard, contrives to place a Pillow stained with Blood on his Bed!-
          Robert enters the Chamber, and attempts the Murder, but is prevented
          by Marguerette's Caution.- Agnes and her Governante now enter the
          Cottage, being benighted in their Journey to the Castle of Lindenberg.
          Raymond, enamoured of Agnes, resolves on saving her: and Marguerette,
          giving him to understand the Wine which is offered is an Opiate, he
          pretends to drink, and affects to sleep.-- The Murderers, thinking
          their Victims secure, leave them to Baptista, who is preparing to
          assassinate Agnes, when he meets his Death by the very Dagger he had
          raised against the Bosom of sleeping Innocence. Marguerette now points
          out the Secret Door, by which they escape. Raymond conducts Agnes to
          the Castle of Lindenberg. Agnes relates the STORY OF THE BLEEDING NUN,
          And tell shim 'tis reported the Spectre haunts the Castle every fifth
          Year. Raymond declares his Passion for Agnes, and is dismissed the
          Castle. Agnes is told that the Intention of the Countess, in sending
          for her to the Castle, is to seclude her forever from the World.
          Terrified at the Idea, she determines to rely on the Honour or
          Raymond's Affection. She drops a Letter from the Turret, in which she
          tells Raymond, 'When the Castle Bell tolls One, Expect me as the
          Bleeding Nun.' Raymond, enraptured at the Idea of seeing Agnes, keeps
          his Appointment. The Bell tolls One. The Castle Gates fly open, and
          the Apparition of the Bleeding Nun is pursued by Raymond. Agnes, as
          the Nun, now appears, and looks in vain for Raymond. She is met by
          Theodore, takes his Protection. They are surprised by the Banditti.
          Agnes confined in a cavern by Robert, Jacques, and Claude. Agnes
          rescued, and the Piece concludes with the Union of Raymond and Agnes.
