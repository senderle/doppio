          [Description of George Barnwell]: This affecting Tragedy, (the moral
          tendency of which has been so useful to the rising generation), may be
          depending upon as founded on fact. The unfortunate Hero of the Piece
          was executed for the murder of his virtuous and venerable Uncle, is
          the reign of Queen Elizabeth; to which he was instigated by an artful
          and abandoned woman. Step by step she led the unwary youth to the last
          cruel deed, which terminated a miserable existence by the most
          ignominous death. A story is recorded (and the fact can be proved by
          many living witnesses,) that a young gentleman of the city of London,
          having embezzled part of his master's property, was providentially at
          a representation of George Barnwell, at Drury-Lane Theatre, at whose
          fate he was so struck, that it caused his immediate reformation. The
          gentleman, benefitted by this excellent Tragedy, was not ashamed to
          acknowledge his obligation to the Play of the Performers; for, at the
          next Benefit, the principal Performers receives One Hundred Pounds
          sterling, with a card to the following effect:- Dear Sir, "One who is
          indebted to your admirable Representation of George Barnwell for more
          than Life, for his redeemed honour and eredit, begs your acceptance of
          the enclosed, which you will receive yearly, so long as you are in the
          line of your profession. Happy am I to acknowledge, that the stage has
          prevented me from Ruin and Disgrace; - George Barnwell stopped me in
          my wild career, and saved me from an ignominious death. I am your
          grateful Friend and Servant, A CONVERT!
