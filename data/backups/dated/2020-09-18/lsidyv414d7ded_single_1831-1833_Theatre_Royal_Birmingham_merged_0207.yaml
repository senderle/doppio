          [Programme for The Bleeding Nun:] Programme- Raymond, being anxious to
          improve his mind by travel, sets forth on his journey, attended by his
          servant Theodore. On his way through Madrid, he accidentally meets the
          fair Agnes, by whose charms his heart is taken captive; but is obliged
          to leave her without declaring his passion. In passing through the
          forest, he is basely betrayed into THE HAUNTS OF BANDITTI, Though the
          treachery of Claude, one of the Band, who has assumed the disguise of
          a postillion. On their entrance to the murderous abode of Baptiste. He
          is beheld by Marguerite, an unfortunate female, who has been compelled
          to become his wife, and, with her child has for three years been
          confined and made witness of the Hellish Crimes committed by Baptiste
          and his sanguinary Gang - she resolves to risk her own life to save
          him - when Robert and Jacques, sons to Baptiste, suddenly enter, and
          attempts to STAB RAYMOND, But are prevented by Marguerite, who shews
          him to a Chamber, where by means of a PILLOW STAINED WITH BLOOD, he is
          made acquainted with his danger. Robert now makes various attempts on
          his life, but by the diligence of Marguerite, is prevented. He now
          quits the chamber and returns to the Supper Room - when his Horror and
          Despair are doubly augmented by the appearance of Agnes, who has been
          betrayed into this DEN OF MURDER, They are saved by the heroic
          behaviour of Marguerite, by whose hand the VILLIAN BAPTISTE FALLS, and
          they effect their escape. Agnes in the Second Act, is induced to quit
          the Castle of Lindenberg, disguised as the SPECTRE NUN which haunts
          the domains. Raymond prepares to meet her, and with joy flies to the
          appointed spot, where he is horrorized by the appearance of the
          SPECTRE OF THE BLEEDING NUN, Which charges him to protect the child of
          the murdered Agnes, which he swears to observe and the Spectre
          vanishes from his sight. He now goes in search of Agnes, who has again
          fallen into the hands of Robert and his Associates, and is on the
          point of falling a victim to their brutality, when Raymond saves her.
          Two of the Robbers fall by the hand of Raymond. Robert attacks and
          disarms him - but is SHOT by Marguerite, and this much interesting
          piece concludes A BLESSING ON THE HEAD OF RAYMOND AND AGNES.
