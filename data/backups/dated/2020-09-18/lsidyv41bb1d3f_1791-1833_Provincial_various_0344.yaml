      notes:
        - '[Description of The Bleeding Nun]: This unrivalled, popular and
        most interesting Play, commences with Don Felix wishing his Son to
        Travil; fearing his health will be imparised by his too constant
        study. Raymond sets forth and sees Agnes, who his leaving the Convent,
        in which she has been educated, and instantly becomes enamoured with
        her, but is prevented from expressing his admiration by the vigilance
        of her Duenna.  Claude, a Postillion, who is connected with a band of Robbers, that
        infest a Forest thro' which they pass, breaks the carriage in which
        Raymond Travels, as if by accident, and betrays him to the Banditti
        under pretence of finding shelter for the night. Raymond encounters a
        variety of adventures, and finally escapes with Agnes and her Duenna,
        who have also been conducted by a treacherous guide to his ABODE OF
        HORROR, and reaches the Castle of Lindenberg unmolested; the Baron
        receives him with kindness as the protector of Agnes, but being
        informed that he is paying his addresses to her, he instantly
        dismisses him from the Castle, Agnes is determined to follow his
        fortunes, and inform him of her intention of personating a bleeding
        Nun, (which is reported nocturnally to preambulate the Castle Walls,
        exactly at one o'Clock,) by dropping from a window with this Scroll.
        "When the Castle Bell tolls one, Expect me like the Bleeding Nun."
        Delighted with this information, he punctually attends and as the
        Clock strikes one, the Spectre of a Nun with a Lamp in one hand and a
        Dagger in the other, it appears Raymond supposeing it to be Agnes,
        follows and attempts to embrace it on which it vanishes and in its
        room appears a transparency with this inscription. "Protect the Child
        of the Murdered Agnes." Agnes not meeting with Raymond sets out in
        search of him and falls a second time into the hands of the Banditti,
        but is happily rescued by Raymond's timely interference; and this
        interesting Piece concludes with their offering of thankfulness and
        Gratitude to that Providence which never fails to pubish vice and
        reward virtue.'
