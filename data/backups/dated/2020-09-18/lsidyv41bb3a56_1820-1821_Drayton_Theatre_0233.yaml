          [Description of Raymond and Agnes]: This unrivalled, popular and most
          interesting Play commences thus: - Raymond sets forth and sees Agnes,
          who is leaving the convent in which she has been educated, and
          instantly becomes enamoured with her, but is prevented from expressing
          his admiration by the vigilance of her Duenna. Claude, a Postillion,
          who is connected with a band of Robbers that infest a forest through
          which they pass, breaks the carriage in which Raymond travels as if by
          accident, and betrays him to the Banditti, under the pretence of
          finding shelter for the night - Raymond encounters a variety of
          adventures, and finally escapes with Agnes and her Duenna, who have
          also been conducted by a treacherous guide to this abode of horror,
          and reaches the castle of Lindenburgh unmolested. Agnes, by unforseen
          events, falls a second time into the hands of the Banditti, but is
          happily rescued by Raymond's timely interference; and the piece
          concludes with their offering of thankfullness and gratitude to that
          Providence who never fails punishing vice, and rewarding virtue.
