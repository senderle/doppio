        - '[Description of Travellers Benighted:] Raymond
        having completed his studies, is entreated by his Father to enter on
        his Travels. He sets out, accompanied by Theodore, his faithful
        Domestic. On entering the Confines of the Forest of Rosenwald, Night
        drawing on, he loses his Way, and, by the Treachery of his Guide
        (Claude), he is led to the Cottage of a Woodman (Baptista,) the
        Captain of a Banditti, who assumes that Disguise more securely to
        commit his Depredations on the unwary Traveller. Robert and Jacques
        (Sons to Baptista) return from their Plunder in the Forest, and enter
        armed. Raymond is conducted to repose in a Chamber. Baptista and Sons
        lay a Plot to murder him. Marguerette, in Order to put Raymond on his
        Guard, contrives to place a Pillow stained with Blood on his Bed!-
        Robert enters the Chamber, and attempts the Murder, but is prevented
        by Marguerette’s Caution.- Agnes and her Governante now enter the
        Cottage, being benighted in their Journey to the Castle of Lindenberg.
        Raymond, enamoured of Agnes, resolves on saving her- and Marguerette,
        giving him to understand the Wine which is offered is an Opiate, he
        pretends to drink, and affects to sleep.-- The Murderers, thinking
        their Victims secure, leave them to Baptista, who is preparing to
        assassinate Agnes, when he meets his Death by the very Dagger he had
        raised against the Bosom of sleeping Innocence. Marguerette now points
        out the Secret Door, by which they escape. Raymond conducts Agnes to
        the Castle of Lindenberg. Agnes relates the STORY OF THE BLEEDING NUN,
        And tell shim ’tis reported the Spectre haunts the Castle every fifth
        Year. Raymond declares his Passion for Agnes, and is dismissed the
        Castle. Agnes is told that the Intention of the Countess, in sending
        for her to the Castle, is to seclude her forever from the World.
        Terrified at the Idea, she determines to rely on the Honour or
        Raymond’s Affection. She drops a Letter from the Turret, in which she
        tells Raymond, "When the Castle Bell tolls One, Expect me as the
        Bleeding Nun." Raymond, enraptured at the Idea of seeing Agnes, keeps
        his Appointment. The Bell tolls One. The Castle Gates fly open, and
        the Apparition of the Bleeding Nun is pursued by Raymond. Agnes, as
        the Nun, now appears, and looks in vain for Raymond. She is met by
        Theodore, takes his Protection. They are surprised by the Banditti.
        Agnes confined in a cavern by Robert, Jacques, and Claude. Agnes
        rescued, and the Piece concludes with the Union of Raymond and Agnes'
      occasions:
