          [Description of Raymond and Agnes]: Programme of the Scenery:--
          Amongst the many interesting incident with which this Piece abounds,
          is the arrival of the Travellers at the Cottage of Baptiste, who, in
          league with a desperate Band, headed by his Sons, makes several
          attempts to accomplish the MURDER OR RAYMOND, who is, however,
          informed of his danger by Margueritte, by means of a blood stained
          Pillow, with which she furnishes his bed, and is by her prevented from
          swallowing a sleeping poison mixed in his drink, by Baptiste, whom he
          overcomes at the moment he is about to perpetrate the murder of Agnes;
          and assisted by Margueritte, ACCOMPLISHES HIS DEATH.- Raymond and
          Margueritte escape the Banditti, and arrive safe at the Castle of
          Lindenberg. At length, Raymond, amongst a train of adventures in his
          pursuit of Agnes encounters THE SPECTRE NUN, whom he discovers to be
          the Mother of Agnes, to whose Spirit he swears from the moment to
          protect her Offspring. He afterwards fulfils his oath by rescuing her
          from the Cave of the Robbers, whom having succeeded in overcoming, the
          SHADE of the MURDERED AGNES being appeased, blesses the Union of her
          Child with her deliverer; which terminates the Drama,- forming a
          striking and interesting conclusion.
