          [Measure for Measure]: Altered and revised by J. Kemble, Esq.

          [On the back of the playbill, a description of Travellers Benighted]:
          Description. Among the interesting incidents with which this Piece
          abounds, is the arrival of the Travellers at the Cottage of Baptista,
          who, in league with a desperate band headed by his sons, makes several
          attempts to accomplish the Murder of Raymond, who is however, informed
          of his danger by Marguerette, by means of a blood-stained pillow, with
          which she furnished his bed, and is by her prevented from swallowing a
          sleeping potion mixed in his drink by Baptista, whom he overcomes at
          the moment he is about to perpetrate the murder of Agnes, and assisted
          by Marguerette, Accomplishes his Death. By means of a concealed
          pannel, leading to a lone path through the forest, they, accompanied
          by Marguerette, escape the Banditti, and arrive safe at the Castle of
          Lindenberg. At length Raymond, amongst a train of adventures in his
          pursuit of Agnes, encounters The Spectre Nun, whom he discovers to be
          the Mother of Agnes, and to whose spirit he swears from that moment to
          protect her offspring. He afterwards fulfills his oath by rescuing her
          from the cave of the Robbers, whom having succeeded in overcoming, THE
          SHADE OF THE MURDERED AGNES, being appeased, ascends amidst the
          clouds, blessing the Union of her Child with her Deliver; which
          terminates the Drama; forming a striking and interesting conclusion.
          New Scenery. Kitchen of Baptista's Cottage. Bed Room in Cottage.
          Outside of Lindenberg Castle. TRANSPARENT CLOUD, which rises as the
          Spectre Descends, Bearing the Following Inscription - "Protect the
          CHILD of the Murdered Agnes." CAVERN SCENE, Which opens and discovers
          the Spectre Nun ascending amidst Clouds, Painted by Mr. Cowell and Mr.
          Brown. Full length Portrait of the BLEEDING-NUN, and Bust of Raymond,
          Executed by Mr. Jefferson of Sunderland.
