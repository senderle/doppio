          SAVOYARD, and his anxiety to ascertain his Master''s wishes - his strenuous
          endeavours to assist in their completion - combating with the effects of
          his natural propensity to imitation productive of some serious mistakes
          and LUDICROUS BLUNDERS - involving the objects of bis solicitude in  CONSIDERABLE
          DIFFICULTIES, from which however he becomes INSTRUMENTAL in EXTRICATING
          THEM.'

      title: The Dumb Savoyard and His Monkey
    - featuredAttractions:
      - attraction: Since the production of "George Barnwell," no Drama has appeared
          so highly calculated to amend the heart, check the progress of ungovernable
          passion, and excite the tenderest  sympathies of human nature, as the above
          Piece. The incidents are of that description which cannot fail to interest
          every class of auditors. From this Piece, the man of austere principles
          may learn to look with a charitable eye on the errors of a fellow creature,
          and extend that mercy he may one day require; and the revengeful character
          may be taught that the completest triumph over an enemy, is to FORGIVE.
          The story is founded on fact; and the interest of the Piece is considerably
          heightened from local circumstances, the plot lying immediately in the vicinity
          of York.
