    notes:
    - '[Programme for The Bleeding Nun:] Programme- Raymond, being anxious to improve
      his mind by travel, sets forth on his journey, attended by his servant Theodore.
      On his way through Madrid, he accidentally meets the fair Agnes, by whose charms
      his heart is taken captive; but is obliged to leave her without declaring his
      passion. In passing through the forest, he is basely betrayed into THE HAUNTS
      OF BANDITTI, Though the treachery of Claude, one of the Band, who has assumed
      the disguise of a postillion. On their entrance to the murderous abode of Baptiste.
      He is beheld by Marguerite, an unfortunate female, who has been compelled to
      become his wife, and, with her child has for three years been confined and made
      witness of the Hellish Crimes committed by Baptiste and his sanguinary Gang
      - she resolves to risk her own life to save him - when Robert and Jacques, sons
      to Baptiste, suddenly enter, and attempts to STAB RAYMOND, But are prevented
      by Marguerite, who shews him to a Chamber, where by means of a PILLOW STAINED
      WITH BLOOD, he is made acquainted with his danger. Robert now makes various
      attempts on his life, but by the diligence of Marguerite, is prevented. He now
      quits the chamber and returns to the Supper Room - when his Horror and Despair
      are doubly augmented by the appearance of Agnes, who has been betrayed into
      this DEN OF MURDER, They are saved by the heroic behaviour of Marguerite, by
      whose hand the VILLIAN BAPTISTE FALLS, and they effect their escape. Agnes in
      the Second Act, is induced to quit the Castle of Lindenberg, disguised as the
      SPECTRE NUN which haunts the domains. Raymond prepares to meet her, and with
      joy flies to the appointed spot, where he is horrorized by the appearance of
      the SPECTRE OF THE BLEEDING NUN, Which charges him to protect the child of the
      murdered Agnes, which he swears to observe and the Spectre vanishes from his
      sight. He now goes in search of Agnes, who has again fallen into the hands of
      Robert and his Associates, and is on the point of falling a victim to their
      brutality, when Raymond saves her. Two of the Robbers fall by the hand of Raymond.
      Robert attacks and disarms him - but is SHOT by Marguerite, and this much interesting
      piece concludes A BLESSING ON THE HEAD OF RAYMOND AND AGNES.'
