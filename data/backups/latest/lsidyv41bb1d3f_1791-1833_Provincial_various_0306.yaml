    notes:
    - '[Description of The Bleeding Nun]: This unrivalled, popular and most interesting
      Play, commences with Don Felix wishing his Son to Travil; fearing his health
      will be imparised by his too constant study. Raymond sets forth and sees Agnes,
      who his leaving the Convent, in which she has been educated, and instantly becomes
      enamoured with her, but is prevented from expressing his admiration by the vigilance
      of her Duenna.  Claude, a Postillion, who is connected with a band of Robbers,
      that infest a Forest thro'' which they pass, breaks the carriage in which Raymond
      Travels, as if by accident, and betrays him to the Banditti under pretence of
      finding shelter for the night. Raymond encounters a variety of adventures, and
      finally escapes with Agnes and her Duenna, who have also been conducted by a
      treacherous guide to his ABODE OF HORROR, and reaches the Castle of Lindenberg
      unmolested; the Baron receives him with kindness as the protector of Agnes,
      but being informed that he is paying his addresses to her, he instantly dismisses
      him from the Castle, Agnes is determined to follow his fortunes, and inform
      him of her intention of personating a bleeding Nun, (which is reported nocturnally
      to preambulate the Castle Walls, exactly at one o''Clock,) by dropping from
      a window with this Scroll. "When the Castle Bell tolls one, Expect me like the
      Bleeding Nun." Delighted with this information, he punctually attends and as
      the Clock strikes one, the Spectre of a Nun with a Lamp in one hand and a Dagger
      in the other, it appears Raymond supposeing it to be Agnes, follows and attempts
      to embrace it on which it vanishes and in its room appears a transparency with
      this inscription. Protect the Child of the Murdered Agnes!Agnes not meeting
      with Raymond sets out in search of him and falls a second time into the hands
      of the Banditti, but is happily rescued by Raymond''s timely interference; and
      this interesting Piece concludes with their offering of thankfulness and Gratitude
      to that Providence which never fails to pubish vice and reward virtue.'
