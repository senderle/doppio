    - '[Sketch of The Travellers Benighted]: Sketch of the Story:- Raymond having
      completed his studies, is entreated by his Father to enter on his Travels. He
      sets out, accompanied by Theodore, his faithful Domestic. On entering the Confines
      of the Forest of Rosenwald, Night drawing on, he loses his Way, and, by the
      Treachery of his Guide (Claude), he is led to the Cottage of a Woodman (Baptista,)
      the Captain of a Banditti, who assumes that Disguise more securely to commit
      his Depredations on the unwary Traveller. Robert and Jacques (Sons to Baptista)
      return from their Plunder in the Forest, and enter armed. Raymond is conducted
      to repose in a Chamber. Baptista and Sons lay a Plot to murder him. Marguerette,
      in Order to put Raymond on his Guard, contrives to place a Pillow stained with
      Blood on his Bed!- Robert enters the Chamber, and attempts the Murder, but is
      prevented by Marguerette''''s Caution.- Agnes and her Governante now enter the
      Cottage, being benighted in their Journey to the Castle of Lindenberg. Raymond,
      enamoured of Agnes, resolves on saving her: and Marguerette, giving him to understand
      the Wine which is offered is an Opiate, he pretends to drink, and affects to
      sleep.-- The Murderers, thinking their Victims secure, leave them to Baptista,
      who is preparing to assassinate Agnes, when he meets his Death by the very Dagger
      he had raised against the Bosom of sleeping Innocence. Marguerette now points
      out the Secret Door, by which they escape. Raymond conducts Agnes to the Castle
      of Lindenberg. Agnes relates the STORY OF THE BLEEDING NUN, And tell shim ''tis
      reported the Spectre haunts the Castle every fifth Year. Raymond declares his
      Passion for Agnes, and is dismissed the Castle. Agnes is told that the Intention
      of the Countess, in sending for her to the Castle, is to seclude her forever
      from the World. Terrified at the Idea, she determines to rely on the Honour
      or Raymond''''s Affection. She drops a Letter from the Turret, in which she
      tells Raymond, ''When the Castle Bell tolls One, Expect me as the Bleeding Nun.''
      Raymond, enraptured at the Idea of seeing Agnes, keeps his Appointment. The
      Bell tolls One. The Castle Gates fly open, and the Apparition of the Bleeding
      Nun is pursued by Raymond. Agnes, as the Nun, now appears, and looks in vain
      for Raymond. She is met by Theodore, takes his Protection. They are surprised
      by the Banditti. Agnes confined in a cavern by Robert, Jacques, and Claude.
      Agnes rescued, and the Piece concludes with the Union of Raymond and Agnes.'''
