    notes:
    - '[Full description of Raymond and Agnes given:] A Description of the principal
      Scenes in the Pantomime. Scene, A Gothic Library in the Castle of Don Felix,--Raymond
      discovered at his studies, is interrupted by the entrance of Don Felix, (his
      father) who informs him it is his wish he should go upon his travels; Theodore,
      his favorite domestic, intreats to accompany him. The carriage with Raymond
      and Theodore breaks down; Claude points to the hovel, informs they may stop
      there and shelter for the night.-- Scene, the Inside of the Hovel.-- Maugerette
      and her Child discovered. Raymond and Theodore are introduced by Baptist-- Theodore
      is shewn to his room by Maugerette-- Robert and Jaques (sons to Baptist) enter
      armed, making a servile obedience to Raymond, who is conducted to his Chamber
      by Robert.-- Scene, the Bed room prepared for Raymond.-- Maugerette wishing
      to preserve the life of Raymond from the assassins, conveys a Pillow stained
      with blood upon his bed, thereby to inform him of his danger-- she conceals
      herself-- Raymond retires to rest, but is prevented by finding the bloody Pillow,
      and struck with horror, falls into a swoon-- Robert enters-- Attempts to murder
      him-- Is prevented by Maugerette-- and Raymond, at her request, retires.-- Scene
      the Lower Apartment of the Hovel.-- Robert informs his father and brother of
      the ineffectual attempt on the life of Raymond who is brought in by Maugerette--
      A knocking is heard without-- Agnes (who has been also benighted in the forest)
      is led in by Claud, attended by Servants-- Supper is prepared-- Opiates are
      mixed with the wine-- Agnes drinks, and falls into a slumber-- Maugerette begs
      Raymond not to drink, but to put on the semblance of sleep-- Baptist sends Robert
      and Jaques to secure the servants, who have retired; and supposing Raymond at
      rest, prepares to murder him-- Raymond seizes him, and Baptist falls by the
      hand of Maugerette-- who points our a secret avenue; through which she, taking
      her child, Raymond and Agnes escape, followed by Theodore.-- Scene, The castle.
      Raymond about to depart, a paper is lowered by Agnes, containing a drawing of
      the Nun, with the following scroll: - ''WHEN THE CASTLE BELL TOLLS ONE, EXPECT
      ME LIKE THE BLEEDING NUN!'' --Scene the outside of the Castle. Raymond enters
      - the clock strikes ONE! THE APPARITION OF THE NUN comes from the Castle and
      Raymond (supposing it to be Agnes) follows in extacy. Theodore approaching,
      is met by Agnes in the habit of the Nun- agitated by the apparent neglect of
      Raymond.-- Scene, A Wood. Raymond following the Spectre (still supposing it
      Agnes) attempts to embrace it; when suddenly vanishing this inscription is seen:--
      ''PROTECT THE CHILD OF THE MURDERED AGNES!'' --Scene, The Mountain. Robert,
      Jaques, and Claude, (the robbers), discovered at the grave of Baptista. Theodore
      and Agnes enter; Agnes is seized and borne into a Cavern. --Scene, a Wood. Theodore
      and Margette meet Raymond, and inform him of Agnes being seiezed by the robbers;
      they hasten to her rescue. The PIECE concludes with the HAPPY UNION OF RAYMOND
      and AGNES.'
