      - attraction: Taken from the Popular Tale of Raymond and Agnes
        isInterpolation: false
      - attraction: Among the most interesting incidents with which this Piece abounds,
          is the arrival of the Travellers at the Cottage of Baptiste, who, in league
          with a desperate band, headed by his Sons, makes several attempts to accomplish
          the Murder of Raymond, who is however, informed of his danger by Margueretta,
          by means of a blood stained Pillow, with which she furnishes his bed, and
          is by her prevented from swallowing a sleeping poison mixed in his drink,
          by Baptiste, whom he overcomes at the moment he is about to perpetrate the
          murder of Agnes, and is assisted by Margueretta, ACCOMPLISHES HIS DEATH.--
          Raymond and Margueretta escapes the Banditti, and arrive safe at the Castle
          of Lindenberg. At length, Raymond, amongst a train of adventures in the
          pursuit of Agnes encounters THE SPECTRE NUN, whom he discovers to be the
          Mother of Agnes, to whose spirit he swears from that moment to protect her
          Offspring. He afterwards fulfills his oath by rescuing her from the Cave
          of the Robbers, whom having succeeded in overcoming, the SHADE of the MURDERED
          AGNES being appeased, blesses the Union of her Child with her deliverer;
          which terminates the Drama,--forming a striking and interesting conclusion.
