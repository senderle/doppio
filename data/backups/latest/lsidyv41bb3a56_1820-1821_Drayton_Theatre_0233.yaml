    notes:
    - '[Description of Raymond and Agnes]: This unrivalled, popular and most interesting
      Play commences thus: - Raymond sets forth and sees Agnes, who is leaving the
      convent in which she has been educated, and instantly becomes enamoured with
      her, but is prevented from expressing his admiration by the vigilance of her
      Duenna. Claude, a Postillion, who is connected with a band of Robbers that infest
      a forest through which they pass, breaks the carriage in which Raymond travels
      as if by accident, and betrays him to the Banditti, under the pretence of finding
      shelter for the night - Raymond encounters a variety of adventures, and finally
      escapes with Agnes and her Duenna, who have also been conducted by a treacherous
      guide to this abode of horror, and reaches the castle of Lindenburgh unmolested.
      Agnes, by unforseen events, falls a second time into the hands of the Banditti,
      but is happily rescued by Raymond''''s timely interference; and the piece concludes
      with their offering of thankfullness and gratitude to that Providence who never
      fails punishing vice, and rewarding virtue.'
