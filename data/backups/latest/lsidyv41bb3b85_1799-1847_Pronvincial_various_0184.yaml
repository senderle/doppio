  - 'FOR THE BENEFIT OF

    MRS. HOWARD.

    Mrs. HOWARD in announcing her BENEFIT to the Ladies, Gentlemen, and

    Public in general, regrets that through severe indisposition, she has been unable

    to appear before them during the present Assizes, and solicits that share of Patronage
    which she has hitherto received.'
  - 'THE WONDER OF THE AGE!

    MONS. GOUFFE,

    IS ENGAGED FOR THREE NIGHTS.

    The spirit and confidence with which MONSIEUR GOUFFE performs his Tricks, Leaps,
    Escapes from his pursuers, &c. keeps the spectator in constant good humour; nor
    can any emotion of fear, for one moment disturb the pleasure excited by his varied
    feats, as they are all performed with that apparent ease which characterises the
    Animal MONSIEUR GOUFFE is so happy in his imitation of.'
  - LAST NIGHT but 4 of Mr. BUTLER'S Engagement.
