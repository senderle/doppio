    notes:
    - '[Description of Travellers Benighted]: Among the most interesting incident
      with which this Piece abounds, is the arrival of the Travellers at the Cottage
      of Baptiste, who, in league with a desperate Band, headed by his Sons, makes
      several attempts to accomplish the MURDER OR RAYMOND, who is, however, informed
      of his danger by Margueritte, by means of a blood stained Pillow, with which
      she furnishes his bed, and is by her prevented from swallowing a sleeping poison
      mixed in his drink, by Baptiste, whom he overcomes at the moment he is about
      to perpetrate the murder of Agnes; and assisted by Margueritte, ACCOMPLISHES
      HIS DEATH.- Raymond and Margueritte escape the Banditti, and arrive safe at
      the Castle of Lindenberg. At length, Raymond, amongst a train of adventures
      in his pursuit of Agnes encounters THE SPECTRE NUN, whom he discovers to be
      the Mother of Agnes, to whose Spirit he swears from the moment to protect her
      Offspring. He afterwards fulfils his oath by rescuing her from the Cave of the
      Robbers, whom having succeeded in overcoming, the SHADE of the MURDERED AGNES
      being appeased, blesses the Union of her Child with her deliverer; which terminates
      the Drama,- forming a striking and interesting conclusion.'
