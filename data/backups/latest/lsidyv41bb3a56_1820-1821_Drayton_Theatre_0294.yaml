    - '[Description of Raymond and Agnes]: SPECTRE OF THE BLEEDING NUN. This Melo-drama
      is founded on the most beautiful part of Mr. G. Lewis''''s celebrated Romance
      of THE MONK. This piece commences with the departure of Don Raymond from his
      father''''s Castle; he arrives in Madrid; falls in love with the beautiful Agnes,
      who is about to return from the Convent to her native Chateau; Don Raymond is
      determined on following, her Father being a particular friend of his family;
      in this determination he sets out with his faithful Theodore for THE BLACK FOREST,
      Where by the villany of the Postillion the Carriage breaks down, and he is decoyed
      into a Wood-cutter''''s Cottage, which proves to be a retreat for Banditti,
      the terror of the neighbouring Country. After a variety of interesting circumstances,
      (wherein the life of the young Chevalier is frequently attempted), Raymond''''s
      suspicions are entirely confirmed by the contrivances of Marguerite the Robber''''s
      wife; and he discovers at the bed where the treacherous Robert leads him to
      repose, THE CLOTHES AND PILLOW STAINED WITH BLOOD!! Drenched from the heart
      of many a murdered Traveller; he resolves to defend himself to the last, and
      with the aid of Marguerite, eludes their present machinations; but unfortunately
      Agnes and her attendance are likewise betrayed into the fatal Cottage; the villians
      are about to assassinate them all! and to that end administer a sleeping portion
      in her drink - but Heaven in compassion to the innocent, ultimately leads them
      in safety to the Castle of Lindenberg. The Baron however, adverse to the presence
      of Raymond, banishes him the Chateau. In the midst of the despair which this
      circumstance occasions, Raymond receives a billet form the lovely Agnes, couched
      in the following terms: - "When the Castle Bell tolls One, Expect me as the
      Bleeding Nun." To enter into further details of the Scenery, would be to rob
      the Spectators of much of their pleasure which the unexpected events will give.'
