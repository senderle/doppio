    - '[Description of the Nun]: Don Raymond having taken leave of his Father, sets
      out on his Travels, but stopping at Madrid, meets with the fair Agnes, who is
      placed in a Convent opposite his hotel. He quits Madrid to pursue his journey,
      but having taken as a guide a Bandit, HE IS DECOYED IN THE FOREST TO THE COTTAGE
      OF BAPTISTE. After escaping the treachery of the two sons of Baptiste, by the
      heroism of Marguerette who before he retires to bed, shews the pillow Which
      is covered with Blood. He preserves the life of Agnes, who is also decoyed to
      the Cottage, conveys her to the Castle of Lindenberg. He is refused the hand
      of Agnes by her Uncle, when he endeavours to procure and interview with her
      by a scroll, on which is written- "When the Castle Bell tolls one, Expect me
      as the Bleeding Nun!" He attends the appointed spot, when the real spectre appears
      to him with a lamp and a dagger, decoys him to an unfrequented part of the Wood,
      and vanishes in a FLAME OF FIRE!! When a scroll appears written in Letters of
      Blood! "Protect the Child of the Murdered Agnes." Agnes  also attends as the
      Ghost, who after disappointments, meets with Raymond, and their union is sanctioned
      by the presence of the BLEEDING NUN, And the Destruction of the Banditti. '
