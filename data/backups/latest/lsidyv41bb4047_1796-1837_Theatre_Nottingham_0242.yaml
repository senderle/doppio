    - '[Quote with Heir at Law]: "On my own merits I shall lay no stress," "I am L.L.D.
      and A. Double S."'
    - "[Description of Travellers Benighted:] Raymond having completed his studies,\
      \ is entreated by his Father to enter on his Travels. He sets out, accompanied\
      \ by Theodore, his faithful Domestic. On entering the Confines of the Forest\
      \ of Rosenwald, Night drawing on, he loses his Way, and, by the Treachery of\
      \ his Guide (Claude), he is led to the Cottage of a Woodman (Baptista,) the\
      \ Captain of a Banditti, who assumes that Disguise more securely to commit his\
      \ Depredations on the unwary Traveller. Robert and Jacques (Sons to Baptista)\
      \ return from their Plunder in the Forest, and enter armed. Raymond is conducted\
      \ to repose in a Chamber. Baptista and Sons lay a Plot to murder him. Marguerette,\
      \ in Order to put Raymond on his Guard, contrives to place a Pillow stained\
      \ with Blood on his Bed!- Robert enters the Chamber, and attempts the Murder,\
      \ but is prevented by Marguerette\u2019s Caution.- Agnes and her Governante\
      \ now enter the Cottage, being benighted in their Journey to the Castle of Lindenberg.\
      \ Raymond, enamoured of Agnes, resolves on saving her- and Marguerette, giving\
      \ him to understand the Wine which is offered is an Opiate, he pretends to drink,\
      \ and affects to sleep.-- The Murderers, thinking their Victims secure, leave\
      \ them to Baptista, who is preparing to assassinate Agnes, when he meets his\
      \ Death by the very Dagger he had raised against the Bosom of sleeping Innocence.\
      \ Marguerette now points out the Secret Door, by which they escape. Raymond\
      \ conducts Agnes to the Castle of Lindenberg. Agnes relates the STORY OF THE\
      \ BLEEDING NUN, And tell shim \u2019tis reported the Spectre haunts the Castle\
      \ every fifth Year. Raymond declares his Passion for Agnes, and is dismissed\
      \ the Castle. Agnes is told that the Intention of the Countess, in sending for\
      \ her to the Castle, is to seclude her forever from the World. Terrified at\
      \ the Idea, she determines to rely on the Honour or Raymond\u2019s Affection.\
      \ She drops a Letter from the Turret, in which she tells Raymond, \"When the\
      \ Castle Bell tolls One, Expect me as the Bleeding Nun.\" Raymond, enraptured\
      \ at the Idea of seeing Agnes, keeps his Appointment. The Bell tolls One. The\
      \ Castle Gates fly open, and the Apparition of the Bleeding Nun is pursued by\
      \ Raymond. Agnes, as the Nun, now appears, and looks in vain for Raymond. She\
      \ is met by Theodore, takes his Protection. They are surprised by the Banditti.\
      \ Agnes confined in a cavern by Robert, Jacques, and Claude. Agnes rescued,\
      \ and the Piece concludes with the Union of Raymond and Agnes"
