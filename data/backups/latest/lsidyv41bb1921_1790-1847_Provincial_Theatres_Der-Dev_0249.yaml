    notes:
    - '[Description of Tableaux Vivans]: Macbeth. Macbeth, Macduff. Despair thy charm:
      / And let the angel, whom thou has served, / Tell thee, Macduff was from his
      Mother''''s / womb untimely ripp''''d. King John. Constance, Arthur, Salisbury.
      Arthur - I do beseech you, Madame, be content. Constance - If thou that bidst
      me be content were grim, / Ugly and sland''''rous to they mother''''s womb,
      / Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious, / Patched with foul moles and eye
      offending mark, / I would not care, I then would be content, For then I should
      not love thee. King Henry IV. Part 1. Prince, Hotspur, Falstaff. Oh! Harry,
      thou hast robb''''d me of my youth. / I better brook the loss of brittle life,
      / Than those proud titles thou has won of me. King Henry VIII. Queen Katherine,
      Griffith, Capacius, & Patience.  Lath - Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver
      / This to my lord the King. Cap - Most willingly, Madam. Kath - In which I have
      commended to his goodness the model of our chaste loves, his young daughter.
      Richard III. Richard, Queen, Duchess of York, &c. A flourish, trumpets, - strike
      alarum, drums: / Let not the heavens hear these / Tell-tale women rail on the
      Lord''''s anointed. / Strike! I say. King Henry IV. Part II.  Falstaff, Pistol,
      Justice, Shallow, and Silence. Pist. - Sir John, thy tender lambkin now is King.
      / Harry the fifth''''s the man, - I speak the truth. / When Pistol lies, do
      this, and fig me like / The bragging Spaniard. Fal - What! is the old King dead?
      Pist - A nail in the door, - the things I speak are just.'
    - '[Description of Raymond and Agnes]: Principal Scenery and Incidents. The inside
      of the Hovel - Marguerite and her child discovered - The Bed-room prepared for
      Raymond - Marguerite wishing to preserve the life of Raymond from the Assassins,
      convey - A PILLOW STAINED WITH BLOOD!! upon his Bed, thereby to inform him of
      his danger - She conceals herself. Raymond retires to rest, but is prevented
      by finding the BLOODY PILLOW!! Robert enters; attempting to MURDER HIM, is prevented
      by Marguerite, and Raymond, at her request retires. The lower part of the Hovel
      - Robert informs his father and brother of the ineffectual attempt on the life
      of Raymond, who is brought in by Marguerite - a knocking is heard without -
      Agnes is led in by Claude - supper is prepared, opiates are mixed with wines,
      Agnes drinks, and falls into a slumber - Baptista, supposing Raymond at rest,
      prepares to murder him, Raymond seizes him, and Baptista falls by the hands
      of Marguerite. The outside of the Castle - Raymond''''s departure - a letter
      from Agnes informs him that "When the Castle Bell tolls One, he is to expect
      her like the Bleeding Nun." Outside of the Castle as before, - Raymond enters
      - the Clock strikes ONE! - the gates fly Open - the Apparition of The Nun comes
      from the Castle! A dreary Wood - Raymond following the Spectre, supposing it
      to be Agnes, attempts to embrace it, when suddenly vanishing, A CLOUD RISES
      FROM THE EARTH! bearing the following inscription: "Protect the Child of the
      murdered Agnes." Theodore and Marguerite meet Raymond - inform him of Agnes
      being seized by the Robbers, they hasten to her rescue. The three robbers cast
      lots for the possession of Agnes - she becomes a prize of Robert, he attempts
      to seize her, she resisting, he aims a dagger at  her breast; at this instant,
      Raymond, Theodore, and Marguerite rush in, Robert falls by the dagger of Raymond,
      Jaques by the sword of Theodore, Claude by a pistol from the hands of Marguerite!
      The Piece concludes with the happy Union of Raymond and Agnes.'
