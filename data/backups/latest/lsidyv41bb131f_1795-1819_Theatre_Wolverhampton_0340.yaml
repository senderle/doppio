    notes:
    - '[Full description of Travellers Benighted given:] Short Sketch of the Story:
      Raymond having completed  his studies, is entreated by his father to begin his
      travels; sets out accompanied by Theodore his faithful domestic. On enterering
      the confines of the Forest of Rosenwold, night draws on, he loses his way, and
      by the treachery of his guide, Calude, he is led to the cottage of a wooman,
      Baptista, the captain of a banditti, who assumes the disguise of a woodman the
      more securely to commit his depredations on the unway traveller. Robert and
      Jaques, sons of Baptista, return from their plunder in the forest, and enter
      armed. Raymond is conducted to repose himself in a chamber. Baptista and sons
      lay a plot to murder him. Marguerette, in order to put Raymond on his guard,
      contrives to place a Pillow stained with Blood on his bed. Robert enters the
      chamber and attempts the murder, but is prevented by Raymond''s caution. Agnes
      and her governate now enter the cottage, being benighted in their journey to
      the Castle of Lindenburgh. Raymond enamoured of Agnes, resolves on saving her;
      and Marguerette, giving him to understand the wine is an opiate, he pretends
      to drink, and affects to sleep. The murderers thiking their victims secure,
      leave them to Baptista, who is preparing to assasinate Agnes when he meets his
      death by the very dagger he had raised against sleeping innocence. Marguerette
      now points out the secret passage by which they escape. --Raymond conducts Agnes
      to the Castle of Lindenbergh, and is recieved by the Baron and Countess (the
      only surviving relations of Agnes) with much attention. Agnes relates the Story
      of the Bleeding Nun, And tells him it is reported the Spectre haunts the Castle
      every fifth years. Raymond declares his passion for agnes and is dismissed the
      Castle.-- Agnes is told that the intention of the Countess in sending for her
      to the Castle is to seduce her for ever from the world. Terrified of the idea,
      she determines to rely on the honour of Raymond''s affections, -- she drops
      a letter from the turret, in which she tells Raymond -- "When the Castle Bell
      tolls One, Expect me as the Bleeding Nun!" Raymond, entraptured at the idea
      of seeing Agnes, keeps his appointment - the Bell tolls One - the Castle gates
      open - and THE APPARITION OF THE BLEEDING NUN APPEARS, Is pursued by Raymond
      - Agnes, as the Nun, now appears, and looks in vain for Raymond - she is met
      by Theodore, and takes his protection - they are suprised by the banditti. -
      Agnes confined in a cavern by Robert, Jaques, and Claude - She is rescued, and
      the Piece concludes with THE UNION OF RAYMOND AND AGNES.'
