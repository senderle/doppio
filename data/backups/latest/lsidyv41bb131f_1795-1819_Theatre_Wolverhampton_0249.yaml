    - '''[Description of Travellers Benighted:] Short Sketch of the Piece. Raymond
      having completed  his studies, is entreated by his father to begin his travels;
      sets out accompanied by Theodore his faithful domestic. On enterering the confines
      of the Forest of Rosenwold, night draws on, he loses his way, and by the treachery
      of his guide, Calude, he is led to the cottage of a wooman, Baptista, the captain
      of a banditti, who assumes the disguise of a woodman the more securely to commit
      his depredations on the unway traveller. Robert and Jaques, sons of Baptista,
      return from their plunder in the forest, and enter armed. Raymond is conducted
      to repose himself in a chamber. Baptista and sons lay a plot to murder him.
      Marguerette, in order to put Raymond on his guard, contrives to place a Pillow
      stained with Blood on his bed. Robert enters the chamber and attempts the murder,
      but is prevented by Raymond''''s caution. Agnes and her governate now enter
      the cottage, being benighted in their journey to the Castle of Lindenburgh.
      Raymond enamoured of Agnes, resolves on saving her; and Marguerette, giving
      him to understand the wine is an opiate, he pretends to drink, and affects to
      sleep. The murderers thiking their victims secure, leave them to Baptista, who
      is preparing to assasinate Agnes when he meets his death by the very dagger
      he had raised against sleeping innocence. Marguerette now points out the secret
      passage by which they escape. --Raymond conducts Agnes to the Castle of Lindenbergh,
      and is recieved by the Baron and Countess (the only surviving relations of Agnes)
      with much attention. Agnes relates the Story of the Bleeding Nun, And tells
      him it is reported the Spectre haunts the Castle every fifth years. Raymond
      declares his passion for agnes and is dismissed the Castle.-- Agnes is told
      that the intention of the Countess in sending for her to the Castle is to seduce
      her for ever from the world. Terrified of the idea, she determines to rely on
      the honour of Raymond''''s affections, -- she drops a letter from the turret,
      in which she tells Raymond -- "When the Castle Bell tolls One, Expect me as
      the Bleeding Nun!" Raymond, entraptured at the idea of seeing Agnes, keeps his
      appointment - the Bell tolls One - the Castle gates open - and THE APPARITION
      OF THE BLEEDING NUN APPEARS, Is pursued by Raymond - Agnes, as the Nun, now
      appears, and looks in vain for Raymond - she is met by Theodore, and takes his
      protection - they are suprised by the banditti. - Agnes confined in a cavern
      by Robert, Jaques, and Claude - She is rescued, and the Piece concludes with
      THE UNION OF RAYMOND AND AGNES.'''
