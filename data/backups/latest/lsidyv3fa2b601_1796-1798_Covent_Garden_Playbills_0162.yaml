    - '[Full description of Raymond and Agnes given:] A Description of the principal
      Scenes in the Ballet:

      SCENE, A Gothic Library in the Castle of Don Felix,--Raymond discovered at his
      studies, is interrupted by the entrance of Don Felix (his father), who informs
      him ''tis his wish he should go upon his travels; Theodore, his favorite domestic,
      intreats to accompany him.-- Scene, Madrid; with a View of an Hotel and a Convent.--
      PROCESSION of NUNS and FRIARS--CHORUS-- Agnes, the daughter of Count Lindenbergh,
      discovered at the lattice -Raymond and Theodore enter, order refreshments from
      the Hotel, and proceed on their journey, under the guidance of Claud, one of
      a banditti infesting the neighboring Forest. --Scene, a Forest at Midnight,
      with a distant Hovel. -Enter Baptist (one of the Banditti) disguised as a woodman-The
      carriage with Raymond and Theodore is seen to break down-- Claud, pointing to
      the Hovel, informs them they may there find shelter for the night.-- Scene,
      the Inside of the Hovel.-- Maugerette and her Child discovered. Raymond and
      Theodore are introduced by Baptist-- Theodore is shewn to his room by Maugerette--
      Robert and Jaques (sons to Baptist) enter armed, making a servile obedience
      to Raymond, who is conducted to his Chamber by Robert.-- Scene, the Bed room
      prepared for Raymond.-- Maugerette wishing to preserve the life of Raymond from
      the assassins, conveys a Pillow stained with blood upon his bed, thereby to
      inform him of his danger-- she conceals herself-- Raymond retires to rest, but
      is prevented by finding the bloody Pillow, and struck with horror, falls into
      a swoon-- Robert enters-- Attempts to murder him-- Is prevented by Maugerette--
      and Raymond, at her request, retires.-- Scene the Lower Apartment of the Hovel.--
      Robert informs his father and brother of the ineffectual attempt on the life
      of Raymond who is brought in by Maugerette-- A knocking is heard without-- Agnes
      (who has been also benighted in the forest) is led in by Claud, attended by
      Servants-- Supper is prepared-- Opiates are mixed with the wine-- Agnes drinks,
      and falls into a slumber-- Maugerette begs Raymond not to drink, but to put
      on the semblance of sleep-- Baptist sends Robert and Jaques to secure the servants,
      who have retired; and supposing Raymond at rest, prepares to murder him-- Raymond
      seizes him, and Baptist falls by the hand of Maugerette-- who points our a secret
      avenue; through which she, taking her child, Raymond and Agnes escape, followed
      by Theodore.-- Scene, Inside Lindenbergh Castle-- The mother of Agnes, the late
      Countess pourtrayed in the habit of a Nun.-- The Count discovered viewing the
      picture with agitation-- Kneels to implore forgiveness for the Murder.-- Agnes
      brought in by Raymond, is introduced to the present Countess- she becomes enamored
      of him, offers him her Picture, which he rejects with scorn.-- Scene, the Chamber
      of Agnes-- Portrait of a Nun, with a wound upon her breast, a Lamp, Dagger,
      and a Rosary on her arm.-- Agnes enamoured of Raymond, enters, and prepares
      to draw his Portrait- Raymond entering unperceived, throws himself at her feet,
      and obtains a promise of her hand-- He requests an explanation of the picture
      of the bleeding Nun-- She informs him (in a Song) ''tis the resemblance of a
      Spectre which haunts the Castle every fifth year.-- The Count and Countess approach;
      and in anger order Raymond to quit the castle-- Scene, the Outside of the Castle--
      Raymond, bud to depart, is diverted by the sound of a Mandoline-- A paper is
      lowered by Agnes from the Castle, containing a drawing of the Nun, with the
      following Scrole:-- "When the cattle-bell tolls One,- Expect me like this bleeding
      Nun."-- Scene, the Outside of the Castle as before- Raymond descends the Wall-
      the Clock strikes One- the Gates fly open- the apparition of the Nun comes from
      the Castle- Raymond (supposing it Agnes) follows it exactly- Theodore approaching,
      is met by Agnes in the habit of the Nun- agitated by the apparent neglect of
      Raymond, they retire.-- Scene, a Dreary Wood- Raymond following the specter
      (still supposing it Agnes) attempts to embrace it, when suddenly vanishing,
      a Cloud rises from the earth bearing the following inscription:-- "PROTECT the
      CHILD of the MURDER''''D AGNES."-- Scene, the Mountains-- Robert, Jacques, and
      Claud (the Robbers) discovered a the grave of Baptist- Theodore and Agnes enter-
      Agnes is seized and borne into the Cavern.-- Scene, a Wood- Theodore and Maugerette
      meet Raymond, and inform him of Agnes being seized by the Robbers- They hasten
      to her rescue.-- Scene, Inside of the Cavern.-- The three Robbers cast lots
      for the possession of Agnes- She becomes the prize of Robert- He attempts to
      seize her- She resisting, he aims a stiletto at her breast- At this instant
      Raymond, Theodore, and Maugerette rush in- Robert falls by the dagger of Raymond-
      Jaques by the sword of Theodore- and Claud by a pistol form the hand of Maugerette.--
      Scene the Castle of Don Felix.-- Raymond presents Agnes to his Father, who joins
      their hands; and the Piece concludes with A FINALE and SPANISH FANDANGO.'
