  announcements:
  - The Manager respectfully announces to the Public, that the Night assigned to Mr.
    Vining, in the Winter, having failed in its remuneration, owing to the appointments
    of an unusual number of Fashionable Parties upon the same Evening, combined with
    the inclemency of weather, several of the leading Families of Bath have expressed
    their wishes, at the Box-Office, that a SECOND BENEFIT should be allotted to him,
    when an opportunity night be afforded them of testifying the approbation in which
    his talents are generally held.

    notes:
    - '''[Description of Travellers Benighted]: Among the interesting incidents with
      which this Piece abounds, is the arrival of the Travellers at the Cottage of
      Baptista, who, in league with a desperate band headed by his sons, makes several
      attempts to accomplish the Murder of Raymond, who is however, informed of his
      danger by Marguerette, by means of a blood-stained pillow, with which she furnished
      his bed, and is by her prevented from swallowing a sleeping potion mixed in
      his drink by Baptista, whom he overcomes at the moment he is about to perpetrate
      the murder of Agnes, and assisted by Marguerette, Accomplishes his Death, by
      means of a concealed pannel, leading to a lone path through the forest, they,
      accompanied by Marguerette, escape the Banditti, and arrive safe at the Castle
      of Lindenberg. At length Raymond, amongst a train of adventures in his pursuit
      of Agnes, encounters The Spectre Nun, whom he discovers to be the Mother of
      Agnes, and to whose spirit he swears from that moment to protect her offspring.
      He afterwards fulfills his oath by rescuing her from the cave of the Robbers,
      whom having succeeded in overcoming, THE SHADE OF THE MURDERED AGNES, being
      appeased, blesses the Union of the  Child with her Deliverer; which terminates
      the Drama, forming a striking  and interesting conclusion.'''
