    - '[Description of George Barnwell]: This affecting Tragedy, (the moral tendency
      of which has been so useful to the rising generation), may be depending upon
      as founded on fact. The unfortunate Hero of the Piece was executed for the murder
      of his virtuous and venerable Uncle, is the reign of Queen Elizabeth; to which
      he was instigated by an artful and abandoned woman. Step by step she led the
      unwary youth to the last cruel deed, which terminated a miserable existence
      by the most ignominous death. A story is recorded (and the fact can be proved
      by many living witnesses,) that a young gentleman of the city of London, having
      embezzled part of his master''''s property, was providentially at a representation
      of George Barnwell, at Drury-Lane Theatre, at whose fate he was so struck, that
      it caused his immediate reformation. The gentleman, benefitted by this excellent
      Tragedy, was not ashamed to acknowledge his obligation to the Play of the Performers;
      for, at the next Benefit, the principal Performers receives One Hundred Pounds
      sterling, with a card to the following effect:- Dear Sir, "One who is indebted
      to your admirable Representation of George Barnwell for more than Life, for
      his redeemed honour and eredit, begs your acceptance of the enclosed, which
      you will receive yearly, so long as you are in the line of your profession.
      Happy am I to acknowledge, that the stage has prevented me from Ruin and Disgrace;
      - George Barnwell stopped me in my wild career, and saved me from an ignominious
      death. I am your grateful Friend and Servant, A CONVERT! '
