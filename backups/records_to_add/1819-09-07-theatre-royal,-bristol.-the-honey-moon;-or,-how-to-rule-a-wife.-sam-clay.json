Her present engagement is unavoidably limited to three Nights only, during which she will exhibit all her various surprising efforts as repeated upwards of Ferry Nights at the Theatre-Royal, Covent-Garden, to overflowing Houses, and since for three successive Seasons, with unprecedented Nightly attraction at the Vauxhall-Gardens. She will be supported through part of her Ertainments by the admired Mademoiselle Saqui, who is also engaged for three Nights previous to their appearance in the Edinburgh and Glasgow Theatres-Royal."
