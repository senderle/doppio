This being the grand result of effort, activity, quickness of the eye, and rapidity of action. No one who has not witnessed it can form an idea of his excellence, several feats of balancing, Spinning a top on a point as fine as a needle and balancing the same on his chin, and in this situation make it Bow to the Audience while revolving on the above Point and afterwards at the Word of Command, restores it to the same Equilibrium and Steadiness as when first spun. The Wonderful feat with large knives somewhat similar to that of the Balls. Swallowing a stone the size of an egg!! and disposing of the same at pleasure. Also his Manly Activity in throwing a large bal, the size of an 18-Pound Shot, to different parts of his Frame with the greatest ease, he places it between his Feet & by giving a sudden spring, throws it over his Shoulder from whence it alights on the bend of his arm and from thence to several parts of his Body, but finally with a masterly jerk, throws the Ball round his Head without the assistance of his Hands! after several other Achievements, he will conclude with the extraordinary feat of swallowing a sword two feet long!!!",
