Consisting of Various  deceptions with cups & balls changing sand to different Colours. After which a Series of Evolutions with Four Hollow Brass Balls, size of Oranges. His power over them is almost miraculous, he causes them to describe every possible Circle, Horizontally, Perpendicularly, Obliquely, Transversely, round his Legs, under his arms, and about his Head in large and small circumferences with wonderous rapidity, keeping the whole in motion at the same time. This being th grand result of effort, activity, guickness of the eve, and rapidity of action. No one who has not witnessed can form an idea of his excellence. Several feats of balancing. Spinning a top on a point as fine as a needle and balancing the same on his Chin, And in this situation makes it Bow to the Audience while revolving on the above Point and afterward as at the Word of Command, restores it to the same Equilibrium and Steadiness as when first spun. The Wonderful feat with large knives! Somewhat similar to that of the Balls. Swallowing a stone the size of an egg!! And disposing of the same at pleasure. Also his Manly Activity in throwing a large ball, the size of an IS-Pound Shot to different partso f his Frame with the greatest ease. He places it between his Feet & by giving a sudden spring throws it over his Shoulder from whence it alights on the bend of his Arm and from thence to several parts of his Body, but finally with a masterly jerk throws the Ball round his Head without the assistance of his Hands! after several other Achievements he will conclude with the extraordinary feat of Swallowing a Sword Two Feet Long!!!",
