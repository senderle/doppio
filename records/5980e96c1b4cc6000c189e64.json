The difficulty of obtaining that Gentleman's services, during this period of the Year, the great request that he is in, the high terms which the display of his talent commands, all would justify Mr. Mansel in advancing the prices of admission ; but when he takes into consideration the infringement circumstances have compelled him to make in the customary Hull Season, the largeness of the Theatre, and the liberality of the Public, he is induced to forego the right of advance, and to advertise the prices as usual, with the exception that no half price can be admitted. From the shortness of Mr. Kean's Engagement, he cannot repeat any of his Characters. Those Ladies and Gentlemen who take Places, are particularly requested to take Tickets at the same time, or their Places cannot be secured.","NO HALF PRICE"],"documentPrinter":{"location":"Lowgate, Hull","name":"W.
