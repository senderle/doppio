# playbill-database

Originally forked from https://github.com/annamarion/playbill-database

Set up API for first time:
First open mongodb shell and do:
db.createUser({user: "user", pwd: "user", roles: ["readWrite"]})

User and pwd are set up in schema.py(MONGO_USERNAME and MONGE_PASSWORD) which can be changed to what user you create on the last step. The default authrization db is admin.

Cretete first account:

Then modify eve_tokenauth/domain.py line 9. Add POST method and comment line 265(display signup button) in template/functions.js. Now you can create some accounts using normal sign up process. (Since we need to login to add new account, so for the first account, we need to make 'POST' method public).

After creating a few admin accounts, delete POST method in public_methods. Uncomment line 265 in template/functions.js.
Now you can create new accounts in log in status with token authorization.

LOCAL SETUP
-------
In all the following instructions, a value between square braces
(like this: [some_value]) is a placeholder for a value of your choice.
In some cases, this value should be a random string generated by a 
cryptographically secure RNG.

To begin with, in the root directory, create a new folder called .envs:

    $ mkdir .envs

Inside, create a .dockerignore file:

    $ touch .dockerignore

Now, create another directory called .local:

    $ mkdir .local

In it, create three files, .caddy, .eve and .mongo:

    $ touch .caddy
    $ touch .eve
    $ touch .mongo

In .caddy, put
```
    DOMAIN_NAME=localhost
```

In .mongo, put
```
    MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=root
    MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=[root_password]
```
`MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD` should be set to a random string generated 
by a cryptographically secure RNG. (If you use LastPass, for example, 
have it generate a random string of more than 20 characters.)

In .eve, put
```
    EVE_MONGO_USER=[eve_user]
    EVE_MONGO_PASSWORD=[eve_password]
    EVE_TOKEN_SECRET=[random_string]
    EVE_DATABASE_NAME=[your_db_name]
```
`EVE_MONGO_PASSWORD and EVE_TOKEN_SECRET should both be set to random strings
generated by a cryptographically secure RNG. (If you use LastPass, for 
example, have it generate two random strings of more than 20 characters.)

Your current directory in `.envs` should be
```bash
├── .envs
│   ├── .local
│   │   ├── .mongo
│   │   ├── .eve
│   │   ├── .caddy
│   ├── .dockerignore
│
├── the rest of the app
```

Now, build docker-compose from the root directory:

    $ docker-compose build

Before launching the server, we have to create a docker volume called
`playbill-db` as our database with the command below:

    $ docker volume create --name=playbill-db

Now we can launch the server with:

    $ docker-compose up

The server should be up and running. To access the server, use https://localhost.
The homepage is at https://localhost/home


CREATE SUPERUSER
----
A superuser will allow you to log in to and use the features in the web app.

Open a new terminal tab in the root directory of the project. In it, type:

    $ docker ps

to get the list of running containers, and copy the Container ID (the first code)
of the container with the name `pdb_mongo`.

Now, type:

    $ docker exec -it (Container ID) /bin/sh

Where (Container ID) is the id you just copied.

Now, launch the mongo shell inside the docker container as the root user with
the command

    # mongo -u root

You will be prompted for a password. Enter the randomized password you inputted
for `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD` inside `.mongo`.

Inside the shell, open the relevant database by:

    '> use your_db_name

Where `your_db_name` is the name you assigned to `EVE_DATABASE_NAME` above.

And create a new user with this command, where `[eve_user]` and `[eve_password]`
are the same as the values assigned to `EVE_MONGO_USER` and `EVE_MONGO_PASSWORD`.

    '> db.createUser({user: "[eve_user]", pwd: "[eve_password]", roles: ["readWrite"]})

You can now close the shell.

To add a user to login to the website, run the following command:

    $ docker-compose run --rm eve flask createsuperuser

Enter your username and password and the user will be created. You can create as
many users as desired with this command.

From now on, you should be able to sign in using the username and password(s)
that you created.


EXPORT ENTRIES IN THE DATABASE TO A FOLDER
---
This command will dump each entry currently residing in the database as
its own .json file at the location specified by [output_folder]:

    $ docker-compose run --rm eve flask exportjson [output_folder]

LOAD JSON DATA FROM A FOLDER TO THE DATABASE
---
This command will load json files in the given folder into the
database. It takes a single argument, the name/dir of the folder
containing the .json files. In the below command this is given as 
`input_folder`, but be sure to change this with whatever folder 
you are reading from.

The folder should only contain .json objects using the same schema as
the database.

    $ docker-compose run --rm eve flask readjson [input_folder]

CREATE DATABASE INDICES
---
In order to ensure that records are uniquely identified in a human-readable way,
we need to impose a uniqueness constraint at the database level on a field identified
in `settings.py` for that purpose: `FILENAME_FIELD = 'myIdField`. The way to do this
in Mongo is by creating a unique index on `myIdField`. 

To do this, log into the mongo shell as root (as described above) and follow the
instructions here: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/index-unique/

In the future we might also add a keyword search option that would require you to
create a text search index as described here: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/text-search/
